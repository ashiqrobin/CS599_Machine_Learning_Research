# CS599: Machine Learning Research

This repository is for Machine Learning Projects for Machine Learning Research Class

## Project 1:

Here, we use the dataset having information of emails. This emails are collected from office and personal email. Here as an input different feature of is used as input like percent of common words, length of capital latter etc. This is mainly a spam-based dataset where output is the class of spam or not. But the ultimate output of this project is a figure where cross-validation estimate of misclassification rate of tree size and cross validation are represented.

## Project 2:

Here, we use MNIST handwritten digit recognition having the pixel value of all handwritten digits. We use CNN to classify the digits. The final output is a figure where the scenario of error-rate vs epoch size is represented.


The codes are maintained since 2019
